libmcrypt
=========

Libmcrypt, [Mcrypt's](https://github.com/jackspirou/libmcrypt) companion, is a library of code which contains the actual encryption functions and provides an easy method for use.

Why on Github?
======

I use Laravel quite a lot and it requires mcrypt.  I noticed mcrypt has a lot of information in a lot of different places.  I want to combine that information and maintain it so developers who use frameworks built on mcrypt have a one-stop-shop if they want to know more.  I am not a mcrypt source contributor, but I encourage and BEG you to fork this and improve the docs - and one day if you dare... THE CODE!
